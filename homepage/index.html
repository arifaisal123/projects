        <h1>Hi, This is Arif</h1>
          <p>Hello, everyone! I hope you are all enjoying the CS50 course as much as I am.</p>
          <p>
            I am Arif Faisal from Bangladesh,
            a South-Asian country, where we have the longest natural unbroken sea beach of the world in Cox's Bazar (You're
            all invited! :)).
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently self-employed, with around 4 years of corporate experience in the FMCG, Construction,
            Automobile, and Telecommunication industry.
          </p>

          <p> Per my Academic Credentials, I did my Bachelors in Finance, with a
            Masters in Marketing. I am deeply passionate about Technology, and Computers in general. In Sports, I love football,
            and Formula 1 racing.

      <!-- Brief Write-Up About My Hobbies -->
        <h1> I Love Computer Games</h1>
          <p>
            When I'm not working, I love to play computer games. I grew up in the 90s playing games like Keen, Dangerous Dave,
            Prince of Persia, which were mostly operating in the MS-DOS (An Operating System based on C, and assembly language).
            </p>
            <p>
            In the modern day era, I mostly indulge myself in games like FIFA, F1, GTA, Call of Duty etc. Apart from gaming, I
            love to spend my free time in reading science-fiction, and self-development books.
            </p>
            <p>
            I love to travel, and learn from the people all across the world.

        <!-- Brief Write-Up About My Thoughts on Programming -->
          <h1> Thoughts on Programming in General</h1>
            <p>
            I love to program. That is to say, having experienced different work roles, what amazes me about programming
            is the thought process that you have to go through to solve a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am still a newbie in the programming world, and I have mostly coded in Python.
